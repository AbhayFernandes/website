Hey everyone, I'm a student in Computer Science at MSU. Currently I work at Amazon on Developer Automation.
I've got a couple of projects, a couple of posts and a couple of ideas on this website. Hopefully you end up 
finding it all interesting.

If you have any questions about myself or my blogs, just send me an email.
